    Thanks for visiting! 
  
    I spend my time building web applications with startups in Canada. Never imagined this would be 
    my path in life, so let me explain. 
  
    I was born and raised in Seattle. Growing up I loved basketball and wanted to be in the NBA, but
    short jewish boys rarely make league. In 11th grade I started programming and thankfully
    software became my passion. 
  
    I spent three semesters learning from Ms. Martin, and three summers interning with ADP working for
    Chris Mills. Over a couple years I dabbled in Python, Scheme, Bash, and SQL, as well as earned university 
    credit in Java. 
  
    I moved to Montreal to study computer engineering at McGill University. Ended up releasing an Andriod
    app with Jacob Barnett after my first semester, and learning Ruby On Rails. Later that year I joined 
    Tal and Gary Schwartz to form 4More Innovation, and built a micro-donation platform for sports teams. 
  
    The following summer I applied for undergraduate research, but there weren't positions available for 2nd-years so 
    I participated in a business acceleration program in Toronto with Artur Minacov. We have since formed a new company 
    called Modde with Anthony Guay to take over where Modreal left off. 
  
    Upon returning to McGill, I built a fume hood monitoring service with Marc-Etienne Brunet. We hoped
    to save the university hundreds of thousands of dollars through behavioral change, but the savings were 
    more modest due to optimizations within the chemistry lab infrastructure itself. 
  
    I decided after my fifth semester to postpone my studies indefinitely, as I was already working full-time 
    on ventures. Stay tuned, launching a number of cool projects in the coming months. 
  
    Anyway, enough about me. Hope you enjoy the rest of the site!
