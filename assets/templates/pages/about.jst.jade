    **AJ Ostrow**

    I grew up in seattle a shy, jewish kid obsessed with basketball. I moved to montreal to study computer 
    engineering at mcgill, but left early to work in toronto. I spend most of my time programming in offices
    and cafes. In spare time I read books and drink with friends.

    Creative work is the meaning of life. I hope to develop taste in art and design, and knack for business and 
    product development. I still have a lot to learn, but am always willing to offer feedback on startup ideas, 
    new music, technology stacks, etc. 

    Anyway, some shout outs.
