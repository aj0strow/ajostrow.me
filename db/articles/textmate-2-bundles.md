TextMate 2.0 alpha is avaialable for free download here: http://macromates.com/download

### Why use TextMate?

Sublime costs money, and TextMate is good enough!

### Where Bundles are Located

All of the syntax highlighting and power of TextMate comes from bundles for supporting various languages. What you are looking for is a ".tmbundle" extension. 

My bundles are located in two places. For bundles that come preinstalled with TextMate:

```
~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Managed/Bundles
```

3rd party bundles I installed myself are in:

```
~/Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles
```

### Installing Bundles

To install a bundle, find it on github, and navigate to your 3rd party bundle folder. Then simply:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/REPOSITORY.git BUNDLE_NAME.tmbundle
```

The BUNDLE_NAME does not matter, and usually the author of the bundle will make a suggestion.
